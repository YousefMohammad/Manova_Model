# Manova Model

Using Mulitiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) for estimating different means of species of flower in iris dataset

in Normal analysis of variance we estimate the mean of one feature 

in our case there is many features to estimate the mean of them so we need a new technique 

the species in flower has 3 categories for each category there are many feature effect each category differently 

and for knowing the effect of each category we create a estimating interval for the mean for each one
